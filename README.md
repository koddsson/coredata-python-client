A Python 2/3 client for the Coredata REST API.


Testing
-------
Currently only have unittests which can be transformed into integration test by
disabling httpretty when running them. The integration tests have yet to be run
against a server so expect there to be errors.


Contributing
------------
Feel free to file issues or pull requests if there is something you need or if
something is breaking. You can also get me on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/koddsson).

TODO
----
- Run integration tests against a running server.
